# Topology: the browser only ever talks to this service. It proxies API calls
# to the agent service server-side (route handlers under app/api/*), injecting
# the shared bearer token so the agent stays protected even though both
# services are publicly invocable. See docs/runbook.md.
#
# This closes the gap noted in earlier iterations: previously only the agent
# had a Cloud Run service defined.

# Dedicated runtime SA for the front-end, least-privilege: it only needs to
# read the bearer token from Secret Manager.
