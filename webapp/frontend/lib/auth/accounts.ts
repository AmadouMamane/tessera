/**
 * Seeded operator accounts for the demo (ADR 0009).
 *
 * Phase 1 has no user store: a tiny set of fixed accounts whose passwords come
 * from the environment (Secret Manager in the cloud) with demo defaults so the
 * dashboard works out of the box. Passwords are compared in constant time.
 *
 * The demo intentionally *displays* these credentials in the UI (see
 * `demoCredentials`), which makes the gate theatrical — it showcases the
 * login/RBAC flow rather than restricting access. Turning it into a real
 * restriction = stop displaying them (env passwords become genuine secrets) or
 * move to the Phase 2 OIDC provider with an email allow-list.
