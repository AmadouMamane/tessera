"""Reviewer node — scores the draft response and decides on escalation.

The reviewer fuses three signals into a single confidence score:

* **Grounding** — does every load-bearing claim trace to a retrieved
  document or a tool result? Unsupported claims drag the score down sharply.
* **Coverage** — did the workers actually return useful information, or
  did every lookup come back empty?
* **Guard health** — has the firewall denied anything in this turn? A deny
  alone is not a failure (it might just be a PII redaction), but multiple
  denies on the same tool indicate the user is steering into a wall.

When the fused score falls below
:attr:`GuardSettings.escalation_confidence_threshold`, the reviewer flips
``needs_escalation`` to ``True`` with a structured reason. The graph then
routes to the escalation worker instead of the reporter.

The reviewer is intentionally rule-based and side-effect-free — it must be
deterministic so the regression harness can assert on its outputs.
