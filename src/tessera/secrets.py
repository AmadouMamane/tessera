"""Deployment-aware secret resolution (ADR 0008).

Tessera resolves secrets very differently depending on where it runs, and this
module is the single seam that hides the difference from the rest of the code.

Providers (selected by ``TESSERA_SECRETS__PROVIDER``):

* ``env`` (default) — read from the process environment. On Cloud Run, GCP
  **Secret Manager** is mounted into the environment by the container start-up
  wrapper, so "env" *is* Secret Manager there. This keeps the cloud path free of
  any GCP client at runtime.
* ``gcp`` — read directly from GCP **Secret Manager** via the official client
  (lazy import). Useful when secrets are not pre-mounted as env vars.
* ``vault`` — the on-prem **premium** and recommended path: HashiCorp **Vault**
  / **OpenBao** via ``hvac`` (lazy import). Dynamic secrets, short-lived leases,
  rotation, and an audit log. The on-prem premium compose wires it by default.
* ``sops`` — the on-prem **standard / lighter** option: a SOPS+age encrypted
  file (``secrets.enc.yaml``) decrypted on demand by the ``sops`` binary. GitOps
  friendly, no server to run.

The point is not to implement any cryptography here — every backend delegates to
a battle-tested tool — but to make "where does a secret come from" an explicit,
swappable, deployment-aware decision rather than scattered ``os.environ`` reads.
