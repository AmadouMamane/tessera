"""Post-turn memory formation — the cold-path write of Tier 2 (ADR 0007).

After a turn completes (and only after the guard and reviewer have passed), the
reflector asks a cheap model to extract durable facts about the customer,
screens each candidate through :mod:`tessera.memory.governance` (consent,
anti-poisoning, PII minimisation), and upserts the survivors into the long-term
store. It runs as a background task, never on the user's hot path, and swallows
its own failures.

The same flow powers the nightly consolidation job, which simply calls
:func:`form_memories` over the previous day's turns.
