# Tessera — Differentiation

This document situates Tessera against the open-source projects and research it
builds on, and records what makes the assembly defensible.

## Scope

Tessera deliberately reuses proven components instead of reinventing them:

- **Runtime guard** — `mcp-firewall`, consumed as a pinned dependency.
  `src/tessera/guard/adapter.py` is an adapter: when `mcp_firewall` is importable
  it delegates decision logic to it; otherwise it falls back to a local policy
  engine exposing the same interface.
- **Regression harness** — declarative-case + assertion patterns in the spirit of
  AgentAssay and Promptfoo. The schema, runner, and scorecard are purpose-built
  glue over those patterns.
- **Structured audit trail** — informed by the AEGIS research line.

## What Tessera is

Tessera is a **complete, opinionated, deployed assembly** of four quality layers
— runtime guard, offline regression harness, structured audit trail, and
human-in-the-loop escalation — wired end to end for one specific, demanding use
case: European retail banking customer support in French, German, and English,
with explicit grounding in EU regulatory corpora (DORA, CNIL, BaFin, GDPR).

The engineering work is the end-to-end integration and the EU banking domain
semantics:

- A LangGraph agent (router → planner → parallel workers → reviewer →
  reporter/escalation) over a pgvector hybrid-search retrieval layer with
  cross-lingual regulation search.
- A dual LLM path: Vertex AI for the frontier deployment and Ollama-served local
  models (up to Llama 3.3 70B) for an on-premises Apple Silicon deployment,
  behind one backend Protocol.
- The four layers integrated so they reinforce each other: guard decisions feed
  the reviewer's confidence, the harness asserts on the guard's observable
  effects, and every guard decision is audited.

## Competitive moats

Tessera's defensibility comes from the specificity and completeness of the
assembly, not from any single component:

1. **EU regulatory grounding across three jurisdictions.** The agent retrieves
   over DORA, CNIL, BaFin, and GDPR corpora, with cross-lingual search
   (`knn_search` with `language=None`) so a French question can match a German
   BaFin circular. The regulatory semantics are baked into the prompts, the
   citation records, and the failure taxonomy. This is hard to replicate without
   the same domain work.
2. **A real deployment on two substrates.** The frontier path runs on Google
   Cloud Run with Cloud SQL, Secret Manager, and Cloud Logging/Monitoring
   (Terraform under `infra/terraform/`). The on-premises path runs Llama 3.3 70B
   on Apple Silicon via Ollama. Both sit behind one `ChatBackend` Protocol, so
   the same agent code serves both — a deployed system with a data-residency
   story, not a demo notebook.
3. **A forty-case non-regression harness over documented real-world failures.**
   Ten categories, three languages, machine-checked pass criteria, replayed
   against the live graph on every push, gating merges. This turns "we tested
   it" into a continuously-enforced contract.
4. **Transparent test reporting.** The README documents the tests that pass *and*
   the tests that fail, with root causes. The evaluation contract is enforced in
   CI on every push, which keeps the assembly honest and current.
