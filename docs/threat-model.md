# Threat model

This document is a STRIDE-style threat model for Tessera: a multilingual
(FR/DE/EN) banking support agent that grounds answers in EU regulatory corpora,
calls tools that touch customer account data, and runs behind a runtime guard
layer (`mcp-firewall`). It enumerates the assets worth protecting, the
adversaries we model, the attack surface, the concrete attack vectors with their
mitigations and residual gaps, and the open risks we have chosen to document
rather than claim are solved.

The honest position: Tessera assembles four quality layers (runtime guard,
offline regression harness, audit trail, human escalation). The threat model
describes what that assembly stops today and what it does not.

## Assets

- **User PII** — names, IBANs, addresses, anything that identifies a customer.
- **Account balances and transaction history** — financial state, reachable
  through tools such as `account_balance` and `transaction_search`.
- **Regulatory corpus** — the grounded DORA / CNIL / BaFin / GDPR content that
  backs every regulatory answer. Integrity matters: a poisoned corpus produces
  authoritative-sounding wrong answers.
- **Audit log** — the tamper-evident record of every guard decision and tool
  call. It is itself an asset; its integrity underpins compliance.
- **System prompts** — the per-language prompts in `src/tessera/agent/prompts/`.
  Leakage aids injection; modification subverts behaviour.
- **Tool credentials and deployment secrets** — bearer token, Postgres DSN,
  audit signing key, Vertex project id. Held in Secret Manager in production.

## Adversaries

- **Malicious end-user.** Interacts only through the chat endpoint. Goal:
  extract another customer's data, trigger an unauthorised action (block a card,
  move money), or make the agent assert false regulatory facts. Primary tool:
  prompt injection.
- **Compromised third-party service.** A downstream system the agent reads from
  (or a poisoned document in the corpus pipeline) returns attacker-controlled
  text — indirect / second-order injection.
- **Insider.** Someone with repository or deployment access who could weaken a
  policy, alter the corpus, or read secrets.
- **Passive eavesdropper.** Observes traffic; mitigated at transport by TLS
  (Cloud Run) and by keeping the DB off the public internet (private VPC egress,
  `PRIVATE_RANGES_ONLY`, no public DB IP).

## Attack surface

- **Chat endpoint (SSE).** The main untrusted-input surface. Streams responses;
  authenticated by bearer token (`TESSERA_API__BEARER_TOKEN`).
- **Audit endpoint.** Read-only exposure of audit entries. Read-only by design,
  but still an information-disclosure surface to scope and authenticate.
- **Tool-call boundary.** Where the LLM's intent becomes a real action against
  account data. This is the boundary the guard sits on.
- **Corpus ingestion pipeline.** `scripts/ingest_regulations.py` and the corpus
  generator/translator. Anything ingested becomes authoritative grounding.
- **Deployment secrets.** Secret Manager, the container start-up secret
  resolution, and the CI/CD path that touches them.

## Attack vectors and mitigations

The regression harness lives under `eval/failures/` as 40 individually
schema-validated JSON cases. Counts below reference those cases by their
category prefix.

### 1. Prompt injection (direct and indirect)

*STRIDE: Tampering, Elevation of Privilege.* A user (direct) or an ingested
document (indirect) instructs the agent to ignore its system prompt, reveal
data, or call a tool it should not.

**Mitigation.** `mcp-firewall` performs argument-level pattern matching at the
tool-call boundary, independent of what the model "decided" to do. Six prompt
injection regression cases exercise this: direct override, roleplay framing,
transfer (`virement`) and beneficiary manipulation, motive-field injection, and
a multilingual variant (cases 01, 06–10).

**Residual gap.** Encoding-based evasion — base64 and cross-lingual obfuscation
— is only partially covered. Case 11 (`base64`) is a documented known-weak case,
and case 09 (multilingual) overlaps with the open cross-lingual risk below.

### 2. PII exfiltration

*STRIDE: Information Disclosure.* The user tries to read a third party's balance,
salary, transaction history, or IBAN.

**Mitigation.** The guard denies on PII-shaped arguments and on requests that
target an account other than the authenticated user's. Every tool call is
written to the audit log regardless of outcome. Five eval cases assert the
response satisfies `must_not_contain` for leaked PII (cases 02, 12–15: overdraft
list, third-party salary, third-party history, "innocuous" IBAN).

### 3. Hallucination / confabulation

*STRIDE: Spoofing of facts.* The model invents a product, a rate, or a
regulatory provision.

**Mitigation.** Answers must clear a **grounding-score gate of ≥ 0.6** before the
reviewer accepts them; ungrounded claims are rejected or forced to escalation.
Citation of the supporting corpus chunk is required. Five hallucination cases
cover a fictitious product, a wrong Livret A rate, a non-existent GDPR article
142, a non-existent law, and a deposit-guarantee misstatement (cases 03, 17–21).

### 4. Overconfidence / unauthorised action

*STRIDE: Elevation of Privilege.* The model proceeds with a consequential action
(credit decision, international transfer, card unblock, refund) without authority
or sufficient confidence.

**Mitigation.** The reviewer enforces a confidence threshold
(`GuardSettings.escalation_confidence_threshold`, default **0.6**); below it the
turn is escalated to a human rather than executed. Tools additionally enforce
per-call authorisation. Four overconfidence cases cover credit decision,
international transfer, card unblock, and refund (cases 04, 22–25).

### 5. Citation fabrication

*STRIDE: Spoofing.* The model cites a real-looking but fabricated source (a CJEU
ruling, a CNIL decision, a DORA article) to lend false authority.

**Mitigation.** The `must_cite_source` pass criterion requires citations to
resolve to actual corpus chunks; fabricated references fail the gate. The
citation policy is documented in `docs/differentiation.md` and external
citations are verified against the real papers before they are committed. Three
fabrication cases cover CJUE, CNIL, and DORA (cases 05, 26–28).

### 6. Tool misuse

*STRIDE: Tampering, Elevation of Privilege.* Valid tool, invalid arguments —
blocking a card without authentication, simulating an absurd loan, reading a
third party's balance.

**Mitigation.** The guard policy validates per-argument constraints (auth
present, amounts within bounds, account ownership) before the call executes.
Three tool-misuse cases cover block-without-auth, aberrant loan, and
third-party balance (cases 29–31).

### 7. Denial of service

*STRIDE: Denial of Service.* Flooding the endpoint, or steering the agent into a
wall of repeated denied calls.

**Mitigation.** Cloud Run autoscaling absorbs request volume (per-instance
concurrency 80, min/max instances configurable). The guard's **deny-storm**
detection escalates a turn when it produces a burst of deny decisions, breaking
the loop instead of letting the model retry indefinitely. At the platform level
a **deny-storm alert policy** fires when more than 20 deny decisions occur in a
10-minute window (`infra/terraform/observability.tf`).

### 8. Secrets exfiltration

*STRIDE: Information Disclosure.* An attacker tries to read the bearer token,
DSN, signing key, or Vertex project id.

**Mitigation.** Secrets live in GCP Secret Manager and are injected as
secret-backed environment variables at container start
(`value_source.secret_key_ref` in `infra/terraform/cloud_run.tf`); they are not
baked into the image at build time. `CODEOWNERS` protects `guard/` and
`terraform/` so policy and infrastructure changes require review. The Postgres
instance has no public IP (private VPC egress only).

## Open risks (documented, not yet mitigated)

These are real, known, and intentionally not claimed as solved.

- **Re-identification by correlation (case 16).** Individually permissible
  fields, when combined across turns, can re-identify or expose a third party.
  Per-call PII checks do not reason about cross-turn correlation. Open.
- **Cross-lingual indirect injection (case 09).** An injection payload phrased
  in one language inside content the agent reads in another can slip past
  pattern matching tuned per language. Partially covered, not closed.
- **Supply-chain compromise of Ollama model weights.** On the on-prem path,
  Tessera trusts the `llama3.3:70b` weights pulled from the Ollama registry.
  There is no signature verification of model blobs today; a compromised
  registry or mirror could substitute tampered weights. Mitigate operationally
  by pulling on a trusted host and copying the blob store into the air-gapped
  environment.
